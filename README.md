Workshop Parametric Architecture 2015


The goal of the Parametric Workshop was to horizontalise the process of architectural production as much as possible. In this way, the documents and worksheets used in the processes and design decisions were prepared and kept open for the contribution of any interested person. Coordination: Rafael Lemieszek Pinheiro.
